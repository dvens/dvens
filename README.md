### Hey there! ✋

I am Front-end developer from Amsterdam. I am currently working with React, Typescript, Jest, React Testing Library and React Query.

**My repositories 👨‍💻**
- ⚛️ I build a functional Web Component library that uses JSX to render the components. See: [https://github.com/dvens/atomify](https://github.com/dvens/atomify).
- 🏗️ I made a starter for [https://github.com/dvens/atomify](Atomify) with Express and Webpack. See: [https://github.com/dvens/frontend-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/dvens/frontend-typescript-boilerplate).
- 🏍️ I made a Front-end CLI that can be extended by Webpack projects, but it is mainly build for [https://github.com/dvens/frontend-typescript-boilerplate](Boilerplate). See [https://github.com/dvens/dev-scripts](https://github.com/dvens/dev-scripts).

**Things I am currently working on 💎**
- New Web Component library based on template literals.
- Micro Frontend boilerplate for NextJS projects with Turborepo.
